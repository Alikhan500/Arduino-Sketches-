Working Arduino Sketches 2016


I have made a small automated growbox , and planning to make it better

I will add/update the working code as i learn and improve it by adding more features

Arduino Nano GrowBox Controller v 3.0

Currently it's made using    Arduino nano,   a Thermistor   , a Dht 22 sensor, a Real Time Clock module for time , a four channel LOW level trigger relay module and ssd1306/sh1106 OLED Spi display and a 5v power supply . However, the grow box sketch uses more than 4  relay pins but only some pins are required for a single season for example in summer only cooler pin will be required to switch the relay while heater will remain unused but whatever the requirment is more relays can be added or just the pin numbers for relays in the sketch can be changed  and the actual device connected to that relay can be changed and it will work for that specific season.


I am a new guy in the arduino world or the programming world so it's a steep learning curve 
if anybody has the same project or working on it and has anything to share please  do share
