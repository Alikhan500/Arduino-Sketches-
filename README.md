# Arduino-Sketches-
Working Arduino Sketches 2016
i have a plan to make a automated greenhouse myself as electronics is also my hobby
i will add the working code as i learn and improve it by adding more features
Arduino thermostat temperature controller using a thermistor from a dell laptop battery and ssd1306/sh1106 OLED Spi display
i am a new guy in arduino world or the programming world so it's a steep learning curve 
if anybody has the same project or working on it and has anything to share please  do share
