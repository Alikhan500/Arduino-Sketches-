# Arduino-Sketches-

Working Arduino Sketches 2016


I have made a small automated growbox , and planning to make it better

I will add/update the working code as i learn and improve it by adding more features


Currently it's made using    Arduino nano,   a Thermistor   , a Dht 22 sensor, a Real Time Clock module for time , a four channel LOW level trigger relay module and ssd1306/sh1106 OLED Spi display

I am a new guy in the arduino world or the programming world so it's a steep learning curve 
if anybody has the same project or working on it and has anything to share please  do share
